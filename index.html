                    A 2006 Ferrari F430 is looking for a new home in the U.S. and could be perfect for any Ferrari enthusiast that likes to row their own gears.
                    Unlike more recent generations of Ferrari’s mid-engined V8 supercars, namely the 458 Italia, 488 GTB, and F8 Tributo, the F430 was offered from the factory with a six-speed manual transmission complete with a gated shifter. This particular example has that desirable gearbox and also has just 18,000 miles on the clock.

                <p>Driven by a 21-jewel automatic movement, this Seiko 5 Automatic Gold PVD Stainless Steel Men’s Watch SNK366K1 RRP £199 has an exclusive Seiko 7S26 engine. Starting with the dial, the ever present Seiko logo can be found just below the 12 o’clock position. Firstly, at the 3 o’clock position is a simplistic day and date window making for easy reading. Furthermore, around the edges of the dial are index markers coated in a luminous material for visibility at night. Moreover, this dial is protected by a silver stainless steel case and hardened mineral glass. To equip this timepiece, a gold PVD stainless steel bracelet is fastened using a deployment clasp to sit comfortably around ones wrist.
                 This watch has a water resistance rating of 30 metres, meaning it can be subjected to light splashes but should not be used for swimming.</p>
